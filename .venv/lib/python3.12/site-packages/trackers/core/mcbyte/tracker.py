    The configuration is used only when ``McByteTracker`` automatically creates
    its default real ``MaskManager``. It is ignored when a custom manager is
    supplied directly.

    Args:
        device: Device shared by SAM and Cutie, for example ``"cuda"``,
            ``"cuda:0"``, ``"mps"``, or ``"cpu"``. The default ``"auto"``
            resolves to CUDA when available, otherwise CPU. Apple MPS is
            never auto-selected (measured roughly an order of magnitude
            slower than CPU for this pipeline); pass ``device="mps"``
            explicitly to use it.
        sam_checkpoint_path: Optional SAM checkpoint path. When omitted, the
            default checkpoint for ``sam_model_type`` is used and downloaded
            automatically when necessary.
        sam_model_type: SAM model variant used for box-prompted mask generation.
        cutie_weights_path: Optional Cutie checkpoint path. When omitted, the
            default checkpoint for ``cutie_model_type`` is used and downloaded
            automatically when necessary.
        cutie_model_type: Cutie model variant used for temporal propagation.
        cutie_config_path: Optional Cutie Hydra configuration directory. When
            omitted, it is inferred from the installed Cutie package.
        cutie_config_name: Hydra configuration name loaded by Cutie.
        cutie_use_amp: Whether Cutie may use automatic mixed precision. AMP is
            activated only when Cutie runs on a CUDA device. Disabled by
            default so that default runs use full fp32 precision on every
            backend; opt in explicitly after validating tracking-quality
            parity on your hardware.
        cutie_max_internal_size: Maximum shortest side of frames processed
            internally by Cutie. Larger frames are downscaled before the
            encoder and the propagated masks are restored to the original
            resolution, matching Cutie's own streaming preset. Use ``-1`` to
            propagate at full input resolution (Cutie's offline-benchmark
            behavior; substantially slower on high-resolution streams).
        cutie_mem_every: How often, in frames, Cutie updates its working
            memory. Higher values speed up processing. ``None`` keeps the
            value from the loaded Cutie configuration.
        cutie_use_long_term: Whether Cutie uses bounded long-term memory,
            recommended for videos longer than roughly one minute. ``None``

        cutie_channels_last: Opt-in ``channels_last`` memory format for the

        cutie_compile: Opt-in ``torch.compile`` of Cutie's shape-stable
            per-frame encoder path. Off by default; incurs first-call warmup
            and may alter numerics, so validate fp32 parity before enabling.

class McByteTracker(BaseTracker):
    """McByte multi-object tracker with optional mask-conditioned association.

    McByte extends a ByteTrack-style multi-stage tracking pipeline with
    clear-match locking, reduced assignment, optional camera motion
    compensation, and optional propagated-mask evidence.

    The tracker can operate in two configurations:

    - without a ``MaskManager``, association uses the McByte clear-match locking
      and reduced-assignment procedure with IoU-based similarities;
    - with a ``MaskManager`` (full McByte), masks are additionally used to condition
      ambiguous associations and, when enabled, isolated positive-IoU associations
      below the normal stage threshold.

    When ``enable_mask_manager=True``, the default mask pipeline initializes
    masks from detection boxes using SAM and propagates them temporally using
    Cutie. A custom ``MaskManager`` may instead be supplied directly, for
    example to inject alternative mask components or lightweight test doubles.

    Mask processing follows the original McByte timing. At frame ``t``, masks
    are updated before association using the frame, visible tracklets, newly
    created tracklets, and removed-tracklet events stored after processing frame
    ``t - 1``. Temporarily lost but still active tracklets retain their masks.
    Masks are removed only after the corresponding tracklets are terminated
    during tracker pruning.

    Input frames are expected in RGB channel order. A frame is required when
    mask management is enabled and is also needed for camera motion
    compensation. When no frame is supplied, those frame-dependent operations
    are skipped.

    Args:
        lost_track_buffer: Time buffer, expressed as a number of frames at
            30 FPS, for retaining unmatched tracks before deletion. The value
            is scaled according to ``frame_rate``.
        frame_rate: Sequence frame rate used to scale ``lost_track_buffer``.
        track_activation_threshold: Minimum detection confidence required to
            create a new tracklet.
        minimum_consecutive_frames: Number of successful tracklet updates
            required before assigning a confirmed non-negative tracker ID.
        minimum_iou_threshold_first_assoc: Minimum association similarity for
            matching high-confidence detections to confirmed and lost tracks.
            The default of ``0.1`` follows ByteTrack's deliberately low
            first-association threshold: a broad candidate set is admitted and
            resolved by fused IoU and detection score. In the default mode
            (``enable_mask_manager=False``) this ByteTrack parity is the sole
            safety net. When mask management is enabled, the same broad
            candidate set additionally lets mask-conditioned association resolve
            ambiguities and optional isolations.
        minimum_iou_threshold_second_assoc: Minimum association similarity for
            matching low-confidence detections to remaining tracked tracks.
        minimum_iou_threshold_unconfirmed_assoc: Minimum association similarity
            for matching unconfirmed tracks to remaining high-confidence
            detections.
        high_conf_det_threshold: Confidence threshold separating high- and
            low-confidence detections. Detections with confidence at or below
            0.1 are discarded.
        enable_cmc: Whether to apply camera motion compensation before
            association.
        cmc_method: Camera motion compensation method.
        cmc_downscale: Image downscale factor used during camera motion
            estimation.
        instant_first_frame_activation: Whether tracklets created on the first
            frame receive confirmed tracker IDs immediately.
        state_estimator_class: State estimator class used by newly created
            ``McByteTracklet`` instances.
        iou: IoU implementation used to compute association similarities. When
            omitted, the default ``IoU`` implementation is used.
        enable_mask_manager: Whether to construct McByte's default SAM and
            Cutie mask pipeline. It is disabled by default to avoid loading
            optional heavyweight models when mask-conditioned tracking is not
            requested.
        mask_manager: Optional custom ``MaskManager``. When supplied, it is used
            directly regardless of ``enable_mask_manager``, and automatic
            SAM/Cutie construction is skipped.
        mask_config: Configuration for automatic construction of the default
            SAM/Cutie pipeline. It requires ``enable_mask_manager=True`` and
            cannot be combined with a custom ``mask_manager``.
        minimum_mask_average_confidence: Minimum average confidence of a
            propagated mask before it may influence association.
        minimum_mask_coverage: Minimum fraction of the visible tracklet mask
            that must lie inside a candidate detection box.
        minimum_mask_fill_ratio: Minimum fraction of a candidate detection-box
            area that must be occupied by the tracklet mask.
        enable_isolated_mask_matching: Whether mask evidence may rescue an
            isolated candidate with positive IoU whose association similarity
            is below the normal stage threshold.
        minimum_mask_creation_frames: Number of consecutive frames a confirmed
            tracklet must remain visible in tracker output before its mask is
            created (the SAM prompt plus Cutie ``add_masks``). This defers the
            per-appearance mask encode for very-short-lived tracklets: those
            that terminate before reaching the threshold never pay the encode,
            at the cost of running IoU-only association for those tracklets
            until their mask exists. Because mask conditioning is deferred, this
            can alter tracking output and must be validated for CLEAR/HOTA/
            Identity parity on the target workload. Use ``1`` to create masks on
            a tracklet's first visible frame (the original immediate-creation
            timing). A deferred tracklet is withheld from the mask pipeline
            entirely, including Cutie's initial mask set: when every confirmed
            tracklet is still inside its defer window the first masks are
            produced only once at least one tracklet reaches the threshold.

        This is the main per-frame entry point. If a mask manager is configured and a

        current frame's visible tracklets, newly created tracklets, and explicitly
        terminated tracklet IDs for the next frame's mask update.

        Args:
            detections: Supervision detections for the current frame. Must include
                ``.xyxy``. Confidence (`detections.confidence`) is optional but

                Note this deviates from the ``BaseTracker.update`` default of BGR:
                McByte's SAM and Cutie mask backends consume the frame as RGB
                without any internal channel conversion, so a BGR frame silently

                association). Required for camera motion compensation and for
                mask-manager propagation.
            timestamp: Absolute time of the current frame in seconds, or ``None``
                for fixed-rate mode (``frame_step = 1.0`` per call). When provided,
                capture times must be non-decreasing; elapsed seconds are converted
